**Where we've been**:
This is the second day of a two-day build, and the final day of this module.

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be continuing work on JS Framework explorations.

**Where we're headed**:
In the next class, students will present their findings and research/experience with their assigned javascript framework.

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

> Our primary outcomes and goals for the day are continued confidence building in teaching themselves a new framework and implementation patterns.

## Preparation

### Warm Up

As an option (if time allows), break your class into small groups and complete the [warm-up exercise](../warm-up/README.md) for the day. The warm-ups are designed to take about 30 minutes, working the class through an incremental build of a JS Helper Library and a set of CSS components.

These are a fun way to get your days kicked off, if your schedule and code review time allocation allow for it. Review the [warm-up overview](../../warm-ups/README.md) for guidance.

### Code Review

- Use your code review time today to jointly unblock individuals and re-review any setup or permissions issues

### TOPIC 1: N/A

Students should have the full day to complete their portfolio and framework applications
