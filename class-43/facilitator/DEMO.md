# DEMOS - Gatsby, next.js, and other JS Frameworks

## Execution

Demos are provided in the `demo` folder in the guide repository. You'll need to run them locally instead of at Code Sandbox to get the full impact.

## Next.js

> `demo/next.js`

Lean on the [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/) to show your students where to find the how on each of these steps. The goal here is half to teach them Next.js and half to teach them how to figure something new out.

- Begin by creating a new project `npx create-next-app`
- Create a couple of pages in the `pages` folder
- Note the `index.js` has everything in it
  - Break out the header/footer
  - Break out the styles
- Optionally, create a [custom document](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-document)
  - This removes the need to repeatedly add the header/footer to every 'page'
  - Additionally, you can (finally) get full control over the `<body>` ... unprecedented in React!

## Gatsby (`demo/gatsby`)

Visit the [docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) to show your students where to find the tutorials, examples, and plugins. Gatsby's community is amazing, as are the docs. Inspire your students to press themselves a bit as they build out their Gatsby portfolio site

## Angular

> `demo/angular`

This is a demo using the older AngularJS (v1) framework. It's a game-changer, historically speaking. It was one of the first true dynamic rendering frameworks that earned wide adoption.

Walk the students through the basic tutorial on the home page (do a code review of their simple demo apps) and then build a simple counter with it.

Make the important point that following examples and documentation is not only a great way to learn new frameworks, but it's a great way to cement and re-frame what you already know.
