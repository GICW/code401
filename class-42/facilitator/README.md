# Facilitators Guide: React Native Deployments

## Overview

Students will be continuing work on their React Native Applications

### How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In the previous class we presented the concept of native components and features as well as a new framework, called "React Native" that leverages knowledge of React so that "native" phone apps can be build

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be continuing work on React Native applications

**Where we're headed**:
In the next class, we will start the students down a self-learning assignment where they will be assigned an alternate Javascript framework and will create an application using an unfamiliar toolset.

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

> Our primary outcomes and goals for the day are deeper knowledge of Device Development

## Preparation

- Read up on app store (Google Play and Apple) account setup, deployments, processes

## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](../LECTURE-NOTES.md) notes.

### Warm Up

As an option (if time allows), break your class into small groups and complete the [warm-up exercise](../warm-up/README.md) for the day. The warm-ups are designed to take about 30 minutes, working the class through an incremental build of a JS Helper Library and a set of CSS components.

These are a fun way to get your days kicked off, if your schedule and code review time allocation allow for it. Review the [warm-up overview](../../warm-ups/README.md) for guidance.

### Code Review

- Use your code review time today to jointly unblock individuals and re-review any setup or permissions issues
- You may also use the early part of class time to demonstrate the operations behind Google Play and the Apple App Store
  - Both of these require a payment to become a publisher
  - Both are a pretty large process

### TOPIC 1: N/A

Students should have the full day to complete their mobile applications

## Lab Notes

- The students are to be finishing out their phone apps today and (optionally) getting them deployed.
  - Deployment is a stretch goal.
  - Exposure to it is the key, but we want the students to focus on the building and creativity process.
- Their focus for this lab will be in styling, usability and overall fidelity
- Have them preparing their presentations

## What might students struggle with today?

- Deployment, should they choose to attempt publishing their apps to an app store

## Past bugs, issues or surprises...
