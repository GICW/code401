# DEMOS: Context API - Behaviors

## Installation

### Requirements

- React version 18.2 or higher.

### Steps

1. Follow the instructions for initializing an application with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).
1. Install third party dependencies.
    - `cd` into recently initialized React Application root directory.
    - Run `npm install @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @emotion/react sass`.
    - Libraries
      - [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/pages/getting-started/)
      - [Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass)
1. To test the demo, replace the `src` folder created for you by Create React App (CRA), with the `src` folder provided in the demo folder.
1. Live code the demo application for students.

## Execution

Demos are provided in the `demo` folder in the guide repository. They are created with `create-react-app` and are suitable to install and run locally or at [Code Sandbox](http://codesandbox.io).

At Code Sandbox, simply create a new app using "GitHub" and point it at the the appropriate demo folder and it'll spin the app up for you. Saves a lot of time and also shows the students the value of doing quicker "POC" style work in an online IDE and then executing production code in their actual IDE.

## Context API

> `demo/context`

For this demo, we will be building from the previous demo's functionality, and providing state altering methods as well as raw state

Build this up from scratch, giving yourself another reason to explain all of the wiring.

Note, however, this demo only uses function components.

- Primarily, this is more expedient
- Secondarily, it allows you to re-focus on whats happening vs how many ways it can happen
