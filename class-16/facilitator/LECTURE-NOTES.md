# Lecture Notes: AWS: Cloud Servers

Use this document to add more details, flavor, hints, tricks, ideas to make lecture better. This should tie into the "Why, What, How" sections of the facilitator's README.

Consider the [README](README.md) in conjunction with the [DEMO](DEMO.md) as the single source of truth for a given class, while this document is more of the living, breathing, set of notes from all instructors as to what is historically working well.
