# SOLUTION - React Native

There's no official solution code because this lab is purposefully ambiguous.

Grading should be based on the overall quality of the application, presentation, and the requirements

## Application Requirements

- Use 2 screens / components
- Use and share state between components/screens
- Use at least 1 native device feature (Contacts, Camera, GPS, etc)
- Properly Documented for End Users
- Live Demo & Presentation
