# DEMOS - API Integration

## Execution

Students will be integrating both an authentication server and a data API for their To Do applications today

In the first half of this course, they will have created both, separately as well as an integrated version.

For demo today, you will be revisiting that server with them, doing a complete code-review and deployment to refresh their memories on how to do it. They will be instructed to use their own servers for their lab today.

Demo is in the form of a code review/workshop. It's advisable to have the students pull up their own servers during your demo so that you can work on this as a joint effort

Please refer to the API servers found in the [apps-and-libraries](../../apps-and-libraries) folder of this guide repository for a proper example
